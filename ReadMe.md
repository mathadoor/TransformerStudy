# Transformer Study

## Introduction
The key motivation behind this study is to analyze the learned representations of vision transformers  
and convolutional neural networks. The end goal is still in its infancy and this repository serves as  
a sandbox environment to that end. 

## Plan
The first task I will perform as a part of this study is to recreate some results from the seminal paper  
[Do Vision Transformers see Like CNN?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08810.pdf)
