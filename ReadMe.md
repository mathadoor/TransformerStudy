# Transformer Study

## Introduction
The key motivation behind this study is to analyze the learned representations of vision transformers  
and convolutional neural networks. The end goal is still in its infancy and this repository serves as  
a sandbox environment to develop that goal. 

## Plan
I will be performing the following tasks as a means to analyze the representations.  

0. Implement various similarity measures on various toy datasets as suggested by [Kornblith et. al](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/kornblith19a/kornblith19a.pdf).
The idea is to reproduce the results by the authors.
1. Then I will use the concepts learned from the above to recreate some results from the seminal paper 
[Do Vision Transformers see Like CNN?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08810.pdf).
2. In addition to the above, I should also see how the other similarity measures apply for analysis. This would include
CCA etc.
